# dnn-training
DNN training with several algorithms

Implement the following networks:
1. Logistic regression over flattened version of the images
2. Fully-connected NN with 3 hidden layers over flattened version of the images. Apply batch normalization and dropout to all hidden layers.
3. CNN with at least two convolution layers and two pooling layers. Apply batch normalization to the
convolution layers.
4. A pre-trained ResNet-18 as feature extractor without fine-tuning its parameters. That is, you need to
learn only the parameters of the task head.
5. A pre-trained ResNet-18 as feature extractor with fine-tuning its parameters.
